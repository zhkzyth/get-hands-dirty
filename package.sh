# Move entire file tree from one directory to another
# [courtesy Alan Cox <a.cox@swansea.ac.uk>, with a minor change]
#1) cd /source/directory
#  urce directory, where the files to be moved are.
#2) &&
#  "And-list": if the 'cd' operation successful,
#   then execute the next command.
#3) tar cf - .
#  The 'c' option 'tar' archiving command creates a new archive,
#   the 'f' (file) option, followed by '-' designates the target file
#  as stdout, and do it in current directory tree ('.').
#4) |
#  Piped to ...
#5) ( ... )
#  a subshell
#6) cd /dest/directory
#  Change to the destination directory.
#7) &&
#  "And-list", as above
#8) tar xpvf -
#  Unarchive ('x'), preserve ownership and file permissions ('p'),
#  and send verbose messages to stdout ('v'),
#  reading data from stdin ('f' followed by '-').
#  Note that 'x' is a command, and 'p', 'v', 'f' are options.
#
#Whew!


# More elegant than, but equivalent to:


# cd source/directory
# tar cf - . | (cd ../dest/directory; tar xpvf -)
#
# Also having same effect:
# cp -a /source/directory/* /dest/directory
# Or:
# cp -a /source/directory/* /source/directory/.[^.]* /dest/directory
# If there are hidden files in /source/directory.
